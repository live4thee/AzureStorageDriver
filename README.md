# README #

This is a plug-in for [LINQPad](http://www.linqpad.net) that enables the 
execution of queries against [Azure Table Storage](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/dd179463.aspx).

It allows you to add storage accounts as connections in LINQPad. 
It will list all tables for each account and all columns in each table. 
Since Azure tables can have mixed schemas, a property was added in version 1.1.0
allowing users to specify the number of rows that should be scanned to determine 
the schema of each table. For the same reason, any value types are made
`Nullable<>` since it cannot be guaranteed that they will have a value
for a given row.
